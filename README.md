# Getting started
Get started with Spreadsheet.js by including the source code file as a script in the head of your HTML page:

```HTML
<script defer type="text/javascript" src="Spreadsheet.js"></script>
```

Spreadsheets are generated by selecting an empty `<div>` by its id with the **Spreadsheet** function, where the spreadsheet will be generated. Then, the **createSpreadsheet** method must be called on the selected element, passing in the spreadsheet configuration objects. Similarly, adding any optional styles to the spreadsheet requires calling the **addCellStyle** or **addCellStyleSheet** methods on the selected element.
  
It should be noted that the `<div>` container must be selected by the **Spreadsheet** function before creating the spreadsheet. Similarly, the spreadsheet must be created before adding any styling rules.

## Initializing an existing empty `<div>` element as a spreadsheet:


```js
const mySpreadsheet = Spreadsheet('#myContainer');
```

## Creating a spreadsheet:
This spreadsheet has all the possible option configurations: a number to initialize the number of rows the spreadsheet will have, a boolean to indicate the spreadsheet will be saveable, a callback method receiving the spreadsheet's data and to be invoked when the "Submit" button is pressed, and a 2D JavaScript array to preload data into the spreadsheet.
```js
mySpreadsheet.createSpreadsheet(
  {
    bank: 'text',
    'cash ($)': 'number',
    'credit debt ($)': 'number',
    'investment portfolio ($)': 'number',
    city: 'text',
    'dated opened': 'date',
  },
  {
    rowCount: 4,
    persistent: true,
    submitCallback: (tableArray) => console.log(JSON.stringify(tableArray)),
    data: [
      ['TD', '10000', '1000000', '34535', 'Toronto', '2021-04-06'],
      ['RBC', '50000', '325345', '76868', 'Markham', '2020-06-22'],
      ['AmEx', '10000000', '5644', '76054', 'New York City', '2020-07-06']
    ]
  }
);
```
## Adding a single styling rule:
```js
mySpreadsheet.addCellStyle('10000', 'green');
```
## Adding a styling rule object for multiple styles:
```js
mySpreadsheet.addCellStyleSheet({ TD: '#64f547', RBC: '#5e87ff' });

```
